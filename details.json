However, if you intend to visit Sentani and the beaches on the outskirts of town, it might be best to try public transport. The public transport terminal is there just across the post office. Angkot (public minibus) is convenient and quite economical. Chartered minibus (the taxi) is another option but requires bargaining skills. Again, be sure that to agree to a price before you depart.<br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\\x22color: rgb(51,51,51); font\\u002Dsize: 16.0px; line\\u002Dheight: 22.8571px; text\\u002Dalign: justify;\\x22><br>\\r\\n<\\/span><span style=\\x22font\\u002Dsize: 24.0px;\\x22>Get There<\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>As a capital city of a vast province, Jayapura is well connected to many large cities in Indonesia by air and by sea.
